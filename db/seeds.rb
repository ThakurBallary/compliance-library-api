# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# areas = ["Payroll", "Indirect", "Direct", "Industrial", "Environmental", "Corporate Law", "Health Care", "RERA"]
# areas.each.with_index(1) do |area, index|
# 	Area.create(position: index, name: area)
# end

# 145.times do |i|
# 	Libcompl.create(area_id: rand(1..8), act: "ACT #{i}")
# end
